A set of tools to ease the administration of many similar Gentoo installs
through the liberal use of binary packages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is This For?
-----------------

qbin is used to manage binary packages for a collection of similar Gentoo
systems. It is intended to be a semi-automated front-end to a chrooted binhost.
See the road map for some of the planned features.


State of the Project
--------------------

Development is currently underway on the backend scripts and libraries. Things
will begin to show up in the development branch as they're completed. The first
working release will hit master when it's ready. No ETA is available for this.


Road Map
--------

The following long-term features are anticipated:

* Multiple build chroots.
* Kernel build system.
* Host update management.
* Central web administration.
* Salt integration.
